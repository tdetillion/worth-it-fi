            <h1>Die with Zero</h1>
            <p class="article-subtitle">The Right Ideas, Wrong Format</p>
            <p class="article-meta">by Bill Perkins · Best for: People who need permission to enjoy their money now, or those overly focused on accumulation at the expense of living</p>

            <h2>The Core Idea (Which Could've Been an Essay)</h2>

            <p>Bill Perkins' central thesis is compelling and provocative: you should aim to die with zero dollars. Not because you're reckless, but because dying with millions in the bank means you over-optimized for wealth accumulation at the expense of actually living. Every dollar you don't spend is an experience you didn't have, and experiences have diminishing returns as you age. The time to travel Europe is in your 30s when you can hike and explore, not your 80s when mobility is limited.</p>

            <p>This concept directly challenges the conventional wisdom of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement and traditional retirement planning. While most financial advice focuses on accumulation—save more, invest more, delay gratification—Perkins argues we've overcorrected. We're so afraid of running out of money that we forget to actually use it.</p>

            <p>The problem? Perkins takes this single, essay-worthy idea and stretches it across 240 pages with repetitive examples, unnecessary tangents, and what feels like padding to justify a book-length treatment. By page 100, you've gotten the point. By page 200, you're frustrated that you're still reading variations of the same argument.</p>

            <h2>The Good: Reframing Wealth</h2>

            <p>Perkins introduces several genuinely useful frameworks that challenge how we think about money and time:</p>

            <p><strong>Memory Dividends:</strong> Experiences pay "dividends" throughout your life in the form of memories. A $5,000 trip to Japan when you're 30 doesn't just provide value during the trip—you'll revisit those memories for 50+ years. That's a 50-year return on investment that no stock can match. By this logic, spending money on experiences when you're young isn't frivolous; it's an investment in decades of future enjoyment.</p>

            <p>This concept resonates because it's true. Ask anyone in their 70s what they regret, and it's rarely "I should've saved more." It's "I should've taken that trip," "I should've spent more time with my kids when they were young," or "I should've taken more risks when I had the energy." Perkins quantifies what we intuitively know: time and health are non-renewable resources, and money without them is worthless.</p>

            <p><strong>The Declining Utility of Money:</strong> Perkins argues that money becomes less valuable to you as you age. At 30, $10,000 might fund a month-long adventure through Southeast Asia. At 70, that same $10,000 might sit in your account because you lack the energy or health to use it meaningfully. Therefore, front-loading experiences when they provide maximum utility makes rational sense.</p>

            <p>He's not advocating recklessness—he's advocating optimization. If you're going to spend $50,000 on travel over your lifetime, doing it in your 40s and 50s (when you can still hike, dive, and explore) provides more value than doing it in your 80s (when you're limited to bus tours and river cruises).</p>

            <p><strong>Time Buckets:</strong> Perkins suggests dividing your life into 5-10 year "time buckets" and allocating experiences to each based on when they'll provide maximum enjoyment. Ski trips go in the 20-40 bucket. Grandkid time goes in the 60-75 bucket. World travel goes in the 30-55 bucket. This forces you to confront the reality that some experiences have expiration dates.</p>

            <p>This framework is genuinely useful for anyone who keeps deferring life because "someday" they'll have more money or more time. Spoiler: you won't. Perkins forces you to ask uncomfortable questions: When will you actually take that trip? What experiences are you delaying that won't be possible later? What memories are you not creating because you're optimizing your savings rate by an extra 2%?</p>

            <h2>The Problem: Repetition and Privilege</h2>

            <p>If "Die with Zero" had been a 5,000-word essay, it would be brilliant. As a book, it's exhausting. Perkins makes his point in the first 50 pages, then spends the next 190 pages repeating it with slightly different examples. By the midpoint, you're nodding along thinking, "Yes, I get it. Experiences matter. You've said this seventeen times."</p>

            <p>The book also suffers from a significant blind spot: privilege. Perkins is a hedge fund manager who made millions and now travels the world staying in luxury accommodations. His advice to "spend more on experiences" assumes you have disposable income to spend. For someone living paycheck to paycheck or buried in student loans, "die with zero" isn't inspiring—it's tone-deaf.</p>

            <blockquote>"The goal isn't to die with the most money. The goal is to maximize life experiences while maintaining financial security."</blockquote>

            <p>That quote sounds great until you realize the author has never worried about making rent. There's a vast difference between "I should spend some of my wealth on experiences" and "I have wealth to begin with." Perkins occasionally acknowledges this ("of course, you need basic financial security first"), but it feels like an afterthought rather than a central consideration.</p>

            <p>The book would've been stronger if Perkins addressed the tension head-on: How do you balance front-loading experiences with building the financial foundation that makes those experiences possible? For most people in their 20s and 30s, the answer isn't "spend more now"—it's "build the base first, then optimize spending later." Perkins glosses over this.</p>

            <h2>The Contradictions</h2>

            <p>Perkins wants you to spend more on experiences, but he also wants you to give away money to your kids when they're 30 (when they can use it most) rather than when you die. He wants you to plan your death date and reverse-engineer your spending to hit zero at exactly the right time. He wants you to annuitize your assets to guarantee you don't outlive your money while also maximizing spending.</p>

            <p>These ideas aren't necessarily contradictory, but Perkins doesn't adequately address the complexity. What if you die earlier than expected? What if healthcare costs explode in your 80s? What if your kids are financially irresponsible at 30? The book presents an idealized scenario where everything goes according to plan, which is rarely how life works.</p>

            <p>The advice also assumes a level of financial literacy and planning that most people don't have. "Annuitize your portfolio and calculate your optimal spending rate based on actuarial tables" isn't actionable for someone who's never heard of an annuity. Perkins doesn't provide the step-by-step guidance needed to actually implement his ideas—he just tells you they're good ideas.</p>

            <h2>Where It Fits in Your Financial Education</h2>

            <p>"Die with Zero" is a useful corrective if you've read books like The Simple Path to Wealth and find yourself over-indexed on accumulation. It's a reminder that money is a tool, not a goal. But it's not a standalone philosophy—it's a counterweight.</p>

            <p>The ideal approach combines both perspectives:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Build financial security first (emergency fund, eliminate high-interest debt, save for retirement)</li>
                <li>Then optimize for experiences (don't defer all enjoyment until some distant "someday")</li>
                <li>Front-load meaningful experiences when they'll provide maximum value</li>
                <li>But maintain enough buffer to handle life's uncertainties</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Perkins tips too far in one direction. If JL Collins tells you to save 50% of your income and invest it all, Perkins tells you to save 15% and spend the rest on experiences. The truth is probably somewhere in between, and where you land depends on your values, risk tolerance, and life circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Who Should Read This Book</h2>

            <p>"Die with Zero" is valuable for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Over-savers who have plenty of money but feel guilty spending it</li>
                <li>FIRE adherents who've optimized so hard for early retirement they've forgotten to live</li>
                <li>High earners approaching mid-life who can afford to shift from accumulation to enjoyment</li>
                <li>People paralyzed by "someday" thinking who need permission to take that trip or make that investment in themselves</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This book is less useful for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>People still building financial security (you need the foundation first)</li>
                <li>Anyone living paycheck to paycheck (the advice assumes surplus income)</li>
                <li>Young professionals in debt (focus on elimination and accumulation before optimization)</li>
                <li>Readers who value concise arguments (this could've been a long article)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Verdict</h2>

            <p>"Die with Zero" contains one genuinely important idea: don't over-optimize for wealth accumulation at the expense of living. Money has diminishing returns as you age, and experiences create "memory dividends" that compound over decades. This perspective is valuable and worth internalizing, especially for anyone who finds themselves endlessly deferring enjoyment.</p>

            <p class="rating">★★★☆☆</p>

            <p>The book loses two stars for execution. What should've been a compelling 5,000-word essay gets stretched into 240 pages of repetition. Perkins makes the same points over and over with slightly different examples, and by the halfway point, you're skimming rather than reading. The lack of practical implementation guidance and the blind spots around privilege further diminish the value.</p>

            <p>Read the first 50 pages, absorb the core concepts, and then skim the rest. Or better yet, read a comprehensive summary online and save yourself the time. The irony isn't lost: Perkins wants you to optimize your life experiences, but reading his entire book isn't an optimal use of your time.</p>

            <p>That said, the core ideas are important enough that the book deserves a read—just maybe not a full, cover-to-cover commitment. Pair it with more practical financial advice (like <a href="book-simple-path.html">The Simple Path to Wealth</a>) to balance accumulation with enjoyment. Use it as a reminder to check in periodically and ask: Am I building wealth to use it, or just to watch the number grow?</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways (The Essay Version)</h2>

            <p>If you don't want to read the book, here's what you need to know:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Money is a tool, not a goal</strong> — Dying with millions means you over-saved at the expense of living</li>
                <li><strong>Experiences pay memory dividends</strong> — A trip at 30 provides 50 years of memories; that's a great ROI</li>
                <li><strong>Your ability to enjoy money declines with age</strong> — $10,000 at 35 enables adventures; at 75 it sits in the bank</li>
                <li><strong>Use time buckets</strong> — Map experiences to life stages when they provide maximum value</li>
                <li><strong>Give inheritances early</strong> — Money is more valuable to your kids at 30 than when you're dead</li>
                <li><strong>Don't defer all enjoyment</strong> — "Someday" never comes; build in regular experiences now</li>
            </ol>

            <p>But also remember:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Build financial security first before optimizing for experiences</li>
                <li>Maintain emergency buffers for life's uncertainties</li>
                <li>Balance present enjoyment with future security</li>
                <li>Ignore the parts about perfectly timing your death—it's unrealistic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The best financial life isn't all accumulation or all spending—it's a thoughtful balance that evolves as your circumstances change.</p>
