            <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
            <p>I created Worth It FI because I've seen too many smart, capable people feel paralyzed by personal finance. Not because the information isn't out there—it absolutely is. But because most financial content either talks down to you or drowns you in jargon.</p>
            
            <p>Personal finance doesn't have to be complicated. It doesn't require a finance degree or hours of research every week. The fundamentals are straightforward, and once you understand them, you can make confident decisions about your money.</p>

            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>I learned about investing early, which gave me a massive head start. But even with that foundation, I've navigated the same questions many young professionals face: How much should I save vs. enjoy now? What's the right balance between paying off debt and investing? When is "good enough" actually good enough?</p>
            
            <p>I've led financial education sessions at work and consistently heard the same thing: "I wish someone had explained it this way years ago." That stuck with me.</p>

            <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
            <p>This isn't a blog about extreme frugality or retiring at 30. It's practical financial guidance for people who want to build wealth without sacrificing everything that makes life worth living.</p>
            
            <p>I break down core concepts—401(k)s, IRAs, index funds, emergency funds—into plain language with actionable steps. No gatekeeping, no assumptions about what you already know.</p>

            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <p>I believe in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding over automation</strong> - Know why you're doing what you're doing</li>
                <li><strong>Progress over perfection</strong> - Good financial habits beat perfect planning every time</li>
                <li><strong>Practical over theoretical</strong> - Real strategies you can implement today</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>
            <p>I'm particularly interested in helping people think through competing priorities: building emergency funds while saving for travel, maximizing retirement contributions while paying off debt, optimizing for the long term without losing sight of what matters now.</p>
