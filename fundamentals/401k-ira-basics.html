            <h1>401(k) & IRA Basics</h1>
            
            <p>If you want to build wealth, tax-advantaged retirement accounts are your most powerful tool. The difference between investing in a regular brokerage account and using a 401(k) or IRA isn't just a few percentage points—over decades, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in your pocket instead of the IRS's.</p>

            <p>This isn't complicated. You're already earning income and paying taxes on it. These accounts let you either delay those taxes or eliminate them entirely on your investment gains. That's huge.</p>

            <h2>What Are Tax-Advantaged Accounts?</h2>

            <p>Tax-advantaged accounts are investment accounts that get special treatment from the IRS. Instead of paying taxes on every dividend and capital gain along the way, your money grows either tax-deferred or tax-free.</p>

            <p>There are two main types you need to know about:</p>

            <p><strong>401(k):</strong> An employer-sponsored retirement account. Your contributions come directly from your paycheck before taxes, and many employers will match a percentage of what you contribute. This is the closest thing to free money you'll find.</p>

            <p><strong>IRA (Individual Retirement Account):</strong> A retirement account you open yourself through a brokerage like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. You have more control over your investment options, and it's available whether or not your employer offers a 401(k).</p>

            <h2>401(k) Fundamentals</h2>

            <p>Your 401(k) contributions are deducted from your paycheck before income taxes are calculated. If you make $60,000 and contribute $6,000 to your 401(k), you only pay income tax on $54,000. That money then grows tax-deferred until you withdraw it in retirement.</p>

            <p><strong>Employer match is critical.</strong> If your employer offers to match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary, that's an immediate 50% return on your money. There is no investment strategy that beats that. Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.</p>

            <p>The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 per year. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a "catch-up contribution."</p>

            <p><strong>Roth 401(k) option:</strong> Some employers offer a Roth version of the 401(k). With a Roth 401(k), you pay taxes on your contributions now, but all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. This can be valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or if you're early in your career with a relatively low income.</p>

            <h2>IRA Fundamentals</h2>

            <p>IRAs come in two flavors: Traditional and Roth. Both have annual contribution limits of $7,000 for 2024 ($8,000 if you're 50 or older).</p>

            <p><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Works like a traditional 401(k). You may get a tax deduction for your contributions now, and the money grows tax-deferred. You'll pay income taxes when you withdraw it in retirement. The tax deduction phases out at higher income levels, especially if you're covered by a 401(k) at work.</p>

            <p><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> You contribute after-tax money, but all growth and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. This is an incredibly powerful tool for long-term wealth building. There's something deeply satisfying about knowing that a Roth IRA worth $500,000 in 30 years is actually worth $500,000 to you—not $500,000 minus whatever tax rate you'll be paying.</p>

            <p>The catch with Roth IRAs is that there are income limits. For 2024, the ability to contribute phases out starting at $146,000 for single filers and $230,000 for married couples filing jointly. If you earn above these thresholds, you can still make contributions through a "backdoor Roth IRA" strategy, but that's beyond the scope of this page.</p>

            <p><strong>Which IRA should you choose?</strong> For most people starting out, the Roth IRA is the better choice. You're likely in a lower tax bracket now than you will be later, and tax-free growth for 30-40 years is hard to beat. If you're already in a high tax bracket and want the immediate deduction, a Traditional IRA might make more sense.</p>

            <h2>Priority Order: Where to Put Your Money First</h2>

            <p>If you're wondering which account to fund first, here's the general priority order that makes sense for most people:</p>

            <p><strong>1. 401(k) up to employer match:</strong> This is free money. If your employer matches 50% up to 6% of your salary, contribute at least 6%. Anything less is leaving money on the table.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Max out Roth IRA:</strong> After getting the full employer match, shift focus to maxing out your Roth IRA ($7,000/year). You have more investment options in an IRA than in most 401(k) plans, and the tax-free growth is valuable.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Max out remaining 401(k):</strong> Once your Roth IRA is maxed, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more—ideally up to the $23,000 annual limit if you can afford it.</p>

            <p>This order prioritizes free money first (employer match), then tax-free growth (Roth IRA), then additional tax-deferred savings (401(k)). It's not the only way to do it, but it's a solid default strategy.</p>

            <h2>Action Steps</h2>

            <p>Here's what to do next:</p>

            <p><strong>Check your 401(k) situation:</strong> Does your employer offer a 401(k)? If yes, are you contributing at least enough to get the full match? If not, log into your HR portal today and increase your contribution percentage.</p>

            <p><strong>Open a Roth IRA:</strong> If you don't have one already, open a Roth IRA at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. The process takes about 15 minutes. You can start with whatever amount you're comfortable with—even $100/month adds up over time.</p>

            <p><strong>Set up automatic contributions:</strong> The easiest way to build wealth is to automate it. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your Roth IRA every month. You won't miss money you never see.</p>

            <p><strong>Invest the money:</strong> Don't let cash sit in your retirement accounts earning nothing. Pick a simple, low-cost index fund and invest your contributions. If you're not sure where to start, a target-date fund or a total stock market index fund are both solid choices.</p>

            <p>The sooner you start, the more time your money has to compound. A dollar invested at 25 is worth significantly more at 65 than a dollar invested at 35. Don't wait.</p>
