            <section class="content-section">
                <p>If you want to build wealth, tax-advantaged retirement accounts are your most powerful tool. The difference between investing in a regular brokerage account and using a 401(k) or IRA isn't just a few percentage points—over decades, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in your pocket instead of the IRS's.</p>

                <p>This isn't complicated. You're already earning income and paying taxes on it. These accounts let you either delay those taxes or eliminate them entirely on your investment gains. That's huge.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> What Are Tax-Advantaged Accounts?</h2>

                <p>Tax-advantaged accounts are investment accounts that get special treatment from the IRS. Instead of paying taxes on every dividend and capital gain along the way, your money grows either tax-deferred or tax-free.</p>

                <p>There are two main types you need to know about:</p>

                <p><strong>401(k):</strong> An employer-sponsored retirement account. Your contributions come directly from your paycheck before taxes, and many employers will match a percentage of what you contribute. This is the closest thing to free money you'll find.</p>

                <p><strong>IRA (Individual Retirement Account):</strong> A retirement account you open yourself through a brokerage like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. You have more control over your investment options, and it's available whether or not your employer offers a 401(k).</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i> 401(k) Fundamentals</h2>

                <p>Your 401(k) contributions are deducted from your paycheck before income taxes are calculated. If you make $60,000 and contribute $6,000 to your 401(k), you only pay income tax on $54,000. That money then grows tax-deferred until you withdraw it in retirement.</p>

                <p><strong>Employer match is critical.</strong> If your employer offers to match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary, that's an immediate 50% return on your money. There is no investment strategy that beats that. Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.</p>

                <p>The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 per year. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a "catch-up contribution."</p>

                <p><strong>Roth 401(k) option:</strong> Some employers offer a Roth version of the 401(k). With a Roth 401(k), you pay taxes on your contributions now, but all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. This can be valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or if you're early in your career with a relatively low income.</p>
