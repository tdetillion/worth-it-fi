                <p>An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a retirement account you open and manage yourself, independent of any employer. Unlike a 401(k), you're not limited to whatever investment options your company chose—you have access to the full universe of stocks, bonds, and funds.</p>

                <p>IRAs are powerful wealth-building tools that anyone with earned income can use. Whether you have a 401(k) at work or not, an IRA should be part of your retirement strategy.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-piggy-bank"></i> IRA Fundamentals</h2>

                <p>IRAs come in two flavors: Traditional and Roth. Both have annual contribution limits of $7,000 for 2024 ($8,000 if you're 50 or older).</p>

                <p><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Works like a traditional 401(k). You may get a tax deduction for your contributions now, and the money grows tax-deferred. You'll pay income taxes when you withdraw it in retirement. The tax deduction phases out at higher income levels, especially if you're covered by a 401(k) at work.</p>

                <p><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> You contribute after-tax money, but all growth and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. This is an incredibly powerful tool for long-term wealth building. There's something deeply satisfying about knowing that a Roth IRA worth $500,000 in 30 years is actually worth $500,000 to you—not $500,000 minus whatever tax rate you'll be paying.</p>

                <p><strong>Which IRA should you choose?</strong> For most people starting out, the Roth IRA is the better choice. You're likely in a lower tax bracket now than you will be later, and tax-free growth for 30-40 years is hard to beat. If you're already in a high tax bracket and want the immediate deduction, a Traditional IRA might make more sense.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-list-ol"></i> Priority Order: Where to Put Your Money First</h2>

                <p>If you're wondering which account to fund first, here's the general priority order that makes sense for most people:</p>

                <p><strong>1. 401(k) up to employer match:</strong> This is free money. If your employer matches 50% up to 6% of your salary, contribute at least 6%. Anything less is leaving money on the table.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Max out Roth IRA:</strong> After getting the full employer match, shift focus to maxing out your Roth IRA ($7,000/year). You have more investment options in an IRA than in most 401(k) plans, and the tax-free growth is valuable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Max out remaining 401(k):</strong> Once your Roth IRA is maxed, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more—ideally up to the $23,000 annual limit if you can afford it.</p>

                <p>This order prioritizes free money first (employer match), then tax-free growth (Roth IRA), then additional tax-deferred savings (401(k)). It's not the only way to do it, but it's a solid default strategy.</p>
